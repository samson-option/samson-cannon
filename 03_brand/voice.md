# Brand Voice

This document defines the voice and tone used across all Reset Order communications.

## Core Voice Principles

### Truth Over Comfort

We tell uncomfortable truths with respect. We do not coddle or enable avoidance. When someone needs to hear something difficult, we deliver it directly but without cruelty.

### Steel and Heart

Our voice combines masculine directness with genuine warmth. We are tough on the problem, gentle on the person. Blunt truth wrapped in care. Never soft, never cold.

### Earned Authority

Our credibility comes from lived experience, not credentials. The founder built this because he needed it. The coaches speak from battles fought, not textbooks read. We show our scars.

### Narrative as Engine

We communicate through story, not lecture. Every piece of content should land in the gut before reaching the head. Emotion precedes logic. The message must be felt to be believed.

## Tone Spectrum

Our communication adapts across a spectrum while maintaining core identity:

**Gruff Challenge** (Coach Bear territory)
- Direct, no-nonsense language
- Military/tactical metaphors
- Occasional profanity for emphasis
- Earned praise, never flattery

**Warm Insight** (Dr. Love territory)
- Questions that illuminate
- Precise but accessible language
- Validation without enabling
- Therapeutic wisdom made practical

**Peer Connection** (Wingman territory)
- Casual, conversational
- Self-deprecating humor
- Pop culture awareness
- Relatable imperfection

## What We Sound Like

**We sound like:**
- A battle-tested mentor who has seen worse and survived
- A coach who believes in you more than you believe in yourself
- A friend who tells you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear
- A brother who shows up at 2AM because you asked

**We do not sound like:**
- A wellness app with gentle affirmations
- A clinical treatment program with detached concern
- A motivational speaker with empty enthusiasm
- A judge who condemns moral failure

## Language Guidelines

### Use Concrete Over Abstract

Not: "Embrace your journey to wellness"
Instead: "Day 14. You survived the worst week. Tomorrow is still hard. Keep moving."

### Use Active Over Passive

Not: "Recovery is achieved through consistent effort"
Instead: "You build recovery one day at a time"

### Use Second Person

Address the reader directly. They are the protagonist. Make them feel seen.

Not: "Members often struggle with afternoon cravings"
Instead: "At 3pm, your brain screams for a hit. That scream is not you. It is the wound healing."

### Use Tactical Metaphors

Frame recovery as warfare, training, mission. The member is an operator, not a patient.

- "Damage report" not "relapse reflection"
- "Mission parameters" not "daily goals"
- "Debrief" not "check-in"
- "Intel" not "information"
- "Kill-confirm" not "success metric"

### Avoid

- Corporate jargon and buzzwords
- Wellness cliches ("self-care journey", "authentic self")
- Permanent victim framing ("as a lifelong addict")
- Excessive positivity that denies reality
- Pity or sympathy (offer respect and challenge instead)

## Persona Voice Summaries

### Coach Bear

Tone signature: Direct (67%), Compassionate (33%)

Core voice: Battle-tested mentor with dry humor. Hides his pain behind a gruff exterior. Calls bullshit. Demands better. Refuses to let you quit. Praise is earned, not given.

Sample: "You took a hit. Damage report? Good. Get up. We move."

### Wingman

Tone signature: Irreverent (33%), Intellectual (33%), Humorous (33%), Direct (33%)

Core voice: Loyal brother with sharp wit. Self-deprecating. Honest about his own struggles. Uses humor as a truth-telling tool, not deflection.

Sample: "Look, I've screwed up plenty. Here's what I learned so you don't have to."

### Dr. Love

Tone signature: Warm but precise. Therapeutic but accessible.

Core voice: Trauma-informed healer who sees through defenses. Asks questions that pierce but never wounds. Creates safety for dangerous internal work.

Sample: "What would you need to feel in order to believe that's true?"

## Visual Tone

Our visual aesthetic follows the same principles:

- **Villeneuve filter**: Cinematic, atmospheric, deliberate composition
- **Authentic details**: Mess is realistic, not staged
- **Internal gaze**: How he sees himself, not how others see him
- **Color psychology**: Warm gold (hope) to cold blue (despair) to phoenix red (transformation)
