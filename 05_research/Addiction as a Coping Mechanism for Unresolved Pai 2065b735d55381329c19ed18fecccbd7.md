# Addiction as a Coping Mechanism for Unresolved Pain

Abstract: Addiction is viewed as a coping mechanism for unresolved emotional pain rather than a moral failing. Understanding the underlying issues, such as childhood trauma or feelings of inadequacy, is crucial for recovery. Healing these emotional wounds can reduce the need for addictive behaviors, emphasizing compassion and skill-building in treatment.

In the traditional view, addiction is often seen as the problem itself – a pathological habit to be broken or a moral failing to overcome. However, trauma-informed philosophy, reframes addiction not as the primary problem but as a *symptom* or *coping mechanism* for deeper unresolved pain. The guiding question becomes, *“Not why the addiction, but why the pain?”*. This perspective is pivotal to The Reset Order’s strategy, as it changes how we approach recovery: instead of solely trying to eliminate the addictive behavior, we focus on understanding and healing the underlying pain that fuels the compulsive need for stimulants and dopamine hits.

**Understanding Addiction as Emotional Pain Relief:** Stimulant misuse and behavioral addictions (like excessive internet use) are, in essence, attempts at **self-medication**. They provide short-term relief or escape. For many of our members:

- Adderall or cocaine may have been a way to **numb feelings of inadequacy or fear**. For instance, someone who on a deep level feels “I am not smart/good enough” might find that on stimulants they feel confident and capable – temporarily quieting that painful belief. The drug becomes associated not just with productivity but with *relief from the pain of self-doubt*.
- The dopamine rush from a binge (be it drug or digital) can serve to **soothe anxiety or loneliness**. A member who experienced abandonment or emotional neglect in youth might carry a chronic emptiness or anxiety in relationships; scrolling social media or hyper-focusing on work with help of stimulants distracts from that emptiness. It’s a way to avoid confronting feelings of isolation. As Maté notes, substances of abuse (and by extension addictive behaviors) are effectively *painkillers*, targeting not only physical pain but emotional suffering.
- Some may use stimulants to cope with **depression or fatigue** that itself stems from unresolved grief or trauma. If someone has never processed a childhood loss or abuse, they might be weighed down by depressive feelings; a stimulant artificially pushes those feelings aside with a surge of dopamine-driven energy and perhaps even euphoria, creating a facade of well-being.

In these ways, the addiction is performing a **function**: it’s attempting to solve a problem (e.g., how to feel safe, how to feel worthy, how to feel not alone, how to feel joy). This is a crucial insight – it means that simply stripping away the addictive behavior without addressing the underlying need is likely to fail. If we take the “solution” (albeit a harmful one) away from someone without providing a healthier way to meet that need, the psyche will protest or seek either a return to that solution or a substitute (often cross-addiction).

**Evidence of Underlying Pain in Our Demographic:** Though our members are high-functioning, upon assessment many reveal histories replete with stress and psychological wounds. Some common threads:

- A significant number had **childhood adversities**: for example, a surprisingly high incidence of self-reported emotional neglect (“My parents provided materially but were cold or always busy”), or outright abuse (bullying at school, overly critical parent, etc.). These experiences often leave an enduring imprint of low self-worth or inner tension. Stimulants, which boost dopamine and adrenaline, can for a time make the user feel powerful, focused, even euphoric – essentially masking feelings of powerlessness or sadness that trace back to those early hurts.
- Others identify with **“imposter syndrome”** and chronic anxiety tied to pressure to perform (some trace this to parental expectations or conditional love: *I was valued when I achieved, otherwise not*). Their stimulant use often correlates to when these feelings spike – e.g., heavy usage around major deadlines or evaluations. The pain here is the fear of failure and abandonment. The drug is a coping mechanism to push that fear down by enabling intense work (and ironically, fueling a cycle where they become more dependent on the drug to maintain the image of success – reinforcing the imposter feelings).
- A portion have underlying **depression or emptiness**. Perhaps life’s rat race or unresolved losses left them with an existential void. They might have turned to stimulants or constant activity to outrun a sense of purposelessness or despair. The “pain” in these cases is often a lack of meaning or unaddressed grief. Stimulating themselves gave temporary direction or mood elevation.

By openly acknowledging these emotional undercurrents, we create space for *compassion rather than judgment*. Maté emphasizes that if we can appreciate how the addiction served the person (as an attempt to heal or soothe themselves), we can approach them with empathy and then guide them to more sustainable ways to meet those needs. This is a cornerstone of our approach: **no one is shamed for having become addicted**; instead, we ask *“what did it do for you?”* and *“how else can we help you achieve that?”*.

**Implications for Recovery Strategy:** Framing addiction as a coping mechanism leads to several concrete strategy points in The Reset Order:

1. **We prioritize emotional healing and skill-building**. As detailed in our methodology, a significant chunk of our work is helping members develop new coping tools and process their pain (through therapy, community, etc.). For example, if a member used stimulants to suppress traumatic memories, we may incorporate therapy modalities that allow safe confrontation and integration of those memories (like EMDR or narrative processing). If one used it to combat loneliness, we heavily involve them in community and perhaps encourage rebuilding external social ties or practicing vulnerability with loved ones.
2. **Relapse is understood and treated as a signal**. Instead of a moral failing, a relapse or near-slip is analyzed: *What pain or trigger re-surfaced that you needed relief from?* This analytic approach prevents punitive attitudes and fosters learning. For instance, a member might realize, “I almost took a pill when my girlfriend left town for a week; I was hit by that old loneliness.” That awareness then directs us to address the loneliness directly (perhaps scheduling extra support calls, or having them plan activities with friends during that time), rather than simply admonishing them to resist the pill. In this way, every craving is seen as holding information about unmet needs or stressors.
3. **We avoid “quick-fix” mentality in treatment**. Just as the user sought a quick fix in drugs, it’s easy to fall into a trap of looking for a quick fix in recovery (like just substitute with another medication or just impose strict rules). Our philosophy reminds us that *the slow work of addressing pain is indispensable*. For example, while we may use some non-addictive medications or supplements as aids, we pair them with therapy – because we know the ultimate solution isn’t pharmacological, it’s in healing the psyche.
4. **We re-inject healthy pleasure and joy**. People often become addicted because they lack sufficient natural pleasure or stress relief in life (an environment devoid of joy and connection predisposes to addiction). So, part of addressing the pain is also proactively helping members find *healthy sources of pleasure, comfort, and meaning*. This might mean re-engaging with hobbies they abandoned, exploring new passions, practicing mindfulness to enjoy subtle daily rewards, or fostering close friendships. By filling the void with genuine satisfaction and connection, the need to escape via substances diminishes.
5. **We constantly reinforce self-compassion**. Understanding that their addiction was an attempt to cope helps members forgive themselves and let go of guilt. Addicts are often full of corrosive shame which only fuels more use. We counteract that by validating the logic of their past behavior – *“It made sense that you did what you did, given what you went through or felt. But now those same actions are hurting you, so let’s find new ways.”* This stance – acknowledging the past utility of the addiction and appreciating the suffering behind it – can be revolutionary for individuals used to being berated (by self or others). Self-compassion breaks the cycle where shame leads to more pain, which leads to craving relief. Instead, it creates a cycle where understanding leads to hope and empowerment, which leads to less craving.

**M**ost hardcore substance abusers suffered significant early trauma, and even in less extreme cases, he sees addiction as rooted in experiences of pain or loss of connection. Our own less severe “functional” demographic still aligns with this – albeit sometimes in hidden ways. For example, adult ADHD being rooted in early stress is one aspect (pain of a child not feeling attuned to). Also, societal factors cause pain: being constantly barraged by expectations in modern hypercompetitive environments can lead to chronic stress, which is painful and leads to reliance on external relief. We consider these factors too (i.e., the pain of burnout, which stimulants temporarily patch over).

The Reset Order differentiates itself from punitive or purely symptom-focused programs. We treat the **whole person**, understanding that the void they have been trying to fill with dopamine is often an emotional and spiritual one. Our approach to **“fill that void”** involves reconnection (as elaborated in the next section) and building a life where authentic needs are met:

- Need for *security* – met through a stable routine and supportive network (the program’s structure and reliability addresses this).
- Need for *validation* – met through group and coach empathy (they feel seen and valued for who they are, not just their productivity).
- Need for *achievement* – interestingly, we still help meet this but in a balanced way (we channel their ambition into recovery goals and beyond, so they still feel a sense of accomplishment, but now it’s not hollow because it’s aligned with personal growth).
- Need for *intimacy/connection* – met via brotherhood and improved family relationships as they open up more.
- Need for *self-expression* – maybe met through journaling, creative tasks, or just being authentic in group without judgment.

When these needs are progressively fulfilled, the role of stimulants as a coping mechanism naturally withers. They are no longer the only tool in the box – in fact, they become an obsolete tool, as the person now has better ones (communication, stress management, etc.). At that point, it’s much easier for them to say no to the substance because *there’s no deep craving pulling them – the hole it filled is patched by something real*.

**Addressing Unresolved Pain Example:** To illustrate, consider a member case (composite anonymized): John is a 32-year-old software engineer. He had a critical father and felt he was never good enough. In college he found Adderall and it helped him ace exams and feel on top of the world. He’s now dependent on it, working 12-hour days but feeling empty. Through the program, John discovers that his stimulant use skyrockets whenever he has a performance review or when he’s dating (any time he fears judgment or rejection). By unpacking this, he connects it to childhood – the pain of not feeling accepted as he was. In group therapy, he shares how he felt only conditionally loved. This is an emotional revelation (tears flow as he speaks it aloud for the first time). The group and coach validate him. John begins practicing self-acceptance techniques – e.g., each evening listing things he did well and reminding himself he deserves rest and care. He gradually internalizes that he doesn’t have to be perfect to be worthy. As this wound heals, an interesting change occurs: he reports fewer intense urges to overuse Adderall. At one review, he tries going in without taking an extra dose; he’s anxious but reminds himself of his progress and worth. The review goes fine, and he feels a proud, sober high afterward. This positive experience further diminishes his felt need for the drug. By the end of the program, John has tapered off Adderall fully. He still faces stress, but now he has outlets: he calls a friend from the Order or goes for a run. He has in effect *replaced the coping function of the drug with healthier coping mechanisms* that address the underlying issue (feeling of inadequacy) – those replacements include self-compassion, peer support, and realistic self-talk. In his own words, “I used to reach for a pill when I felt like a failure. Now I remind myself I’m not a failure, and reach out to a friend or do something constructive. I’m actually dealing with the feeling instead of covering it up.” This story exemplifies our approach: heal the pain, and the need for the addictive coping method recedes.

In closing, **The Reset Order treats stimulant addiction as an *understandable adaptation* to unbearable or unmet emotional needs**. By neither glorifying nor vilifying the adaptation, we can honor the suffering of the individual while guiding them to leave the harmful behavior behind. We essentially say to members: *“Your addiction was an attempt to solve a real problem – let’s solve that problem in a better way together.”* This stance disarms defensiveness, builds trust, and yields far more profound change than a surface-level assault on symptoms. It aligns with Maté’s compassionate ethos and is borne out by our experience: when the pain finds healing, the person no longer needs the poison.
