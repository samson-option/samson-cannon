# The Recovery Framework

This document defines the complete methodology for The Reset Order's intervention.

---

## Overview

Recovery requires realignment across three domains:

1. **Neurochemical Reset**: Stabilize dopamine circuitry through abstinence and healthy stress
2. **Behavioral Reconditioning**: Rewire habit loops through environment design and progressive challenge
3. **Identity Reconstruction**: Transform self-concept from patient to sovereign

These domains amplify each other. When all three lock into place, the addiction feedback loop collapses.

## The Core Loop: Scan - Engage - Secure - Reload

The addicted brain operates on a subconscious loop: Trigger > Use > Numb.

We disrupt this by installing a superior loop:

1. **SCAN (Reflect)**: Morning systems check. Orient before triggers plant. "What is the threat level today?"

2. **ENGAGE (Act)**: Tactical strike against the old self. Cold shower, deep work block, denied craving. Action taken in the face of resistance.

3. **SECURE (Reward)**: Capture territory. The brain must learn that Discipline = Dopamine. Immediate tangible feedback after hard tasks rewires the reward function.

4. **RELOAD (Repeat)**: Analyze intel, resupply, prepare for next cycle.

The loop operates daily, often multiple times per day. Over time, it becomes invisible, running on the user's wetware rather than the app.

## The Nine-Month Journey

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Days 1-30)

**Objective**: Stop the bleeding. Establish a perimeter.

**Loop Configuration**: High frequency, low friction

**Tactics**:
- Training wheels: microscopic actions (drink water, box breathe)
- Extrinsic rewards: badges, streaks, AI praise
- Structured stimulant protocol: front-load morning dose, eliminate afternoon redose
- Crash "Soft Landing" routine: behavioral intervention at typical crash time
- Dopamine education and habit audit

**Win Condition**: "I survived the day without a casualty."

**Metrics**: Days without unplanned redose, craving intensity trend, habit adherence rate

---

### Phase 2-3: The Crucible (Months 2-4)

**Objective**: Test the armor. Seize territory.

**Loop Configuration**: High friction, high stakes

**Tactics**:
- **Volt Days**: Scheduled shock events (24-hour dopamine fasts, silence protocols)
- **Autonomy Drills**: AI Coach steps back and demands self-direction
- Environment and lifestyle optimization (sleep, nutrition, digital hygiene)
- Gradual stimulant tapering with medical oversight
- Forge Retreat as capstone challenge

**Win Condition**: "I sought pain and found power."

**Metrics**: Stimulant-free days percentage, sleep consistency, HRV trend, self-efficacy ratings

---

### Phase 4-5: Sovereignty (Months 5-9)

**Objective**: Occupation and rule.

**Loop Configuration**: Internalized and invisible

**Tactics**:
- App becomes secondary; loop runs on biological brain
- Identity-focused coaching and narrative work
- Mentorship transition: recruit becomes officer
- Post-program planning and maintenance protocol
- Support network solidification

**Win Condition**: "I am the captain of my soul."

**Metrics**: Stimulant indifference achieved, intrinsic motivation flow, identity consistency scores

## Key Principles

### Dopamine Fitness

We frame recovery as training, not treatment. Like physical fitness, dopamine fitness requires:

- **Progressive Loading**: Gradually increase healthy stressors and tolerance-building activities
- **Boredom Reps**: Deliberately practice tolerating absence of stimulation
- **Stimulation Budgeting**: Consciously allocate limited daily dopamine capacity
- **Reward Rewiring**: Create new reward pathways through positive reinforcement and savoring

### Craving as Compass

Cravings are not enemies; they are signals. When craving strikes:

1. HALT check: Hungry? Angry/Anxious? Lonely? Tired?
2. Identify the underlying need the craving points to
3. Address that need through healthy means
4. Notice the craving diminish

Each successfully navigated craving builds self-efficacy and dopamine resilience.

### Self-Efficacy Through Evidence

We do not tell members they are strong. We force them to do difficult things and let the evidence speak.

Every completed loop is a "kill-confirm" on a craving. These accumulate into the absolute knowledge: "I can destroy this problem."

This is Battle-Hardening.

## The Dopamine Resilience Score

A composite metric tracking progress across all domains:

**Components**:
- Craving intensity (inversely weighted)
- Habit adherence rate
- Stimulant-free days
- Sleep and HRV indicators
- Identity/confidence self-ratings

**Presentation**: Single intuitive gauge showing trajectory from dysregulated to sovereign

**Function**:
- Daily score provides immediate feedback
- Monthly trend shows durable progress
- Coach Bear adapts support based on score changes
- Low scores trigger intervention; high scores unlock challenges

## The End State

**Stimulant Indifference**: The substance or behavior that once controlled you feels irrelevant.

**Intrinsic Motivation**: Baseline drive flows without artificial aid.

**Incompatible Identity**: Self-concept has transformed into someone for whom old patterns are simply not an option.

The goal is obsolescence. When the loop is hard-coded into neurons, they no longer need us. They have achieved executive agency. They are no longer fighting the war; they have won it.
