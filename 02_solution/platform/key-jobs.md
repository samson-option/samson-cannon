# High-Value Jobs for the MVP

To craft a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for the Coach Bear experience, we should focus on a few core features that deliver the most value to users. Simplifying the grand vision down to its **essential jobs** ensures we build a product that is impactful while staying lean. Below are the high-value jobs/functions the MVP should cover:

1. **Immersive Onboarding Narrative (Simplified Text Experience):** Kick off with a motivational **“Reclaim Your Throne”** story, but keep it simple for MVP. Instead of a complex cinematic with voice-overs, use **text-based storytelling with evocative images or illustrations**. The goal is to give new users an emotional hook and a sense of entering a special journey. For example, present a short narrative of the young man in the alley and the throne vision in a **mobile-friendly scrollable format** (think illustrated story panels with captions). At key points, prompt the user to enter basic info (like their **name or one personal goal**) via text input. This personalizes the experience (e.g. *“Welcome, John, to your journey”*) without the need for advanced voice/video recording. Include a **skip option** so users can bypass this intro if they prefer, but make the default experience engaging enough that most won’t want to skip. This onboarding delivers the inspirational spark using **minimal tech complexity** (text, images, form inputs) – high impact with low implementation cost.

2. **Daily Coaching Guidance from Coach Bear (Text Chat):** The cornerstone of the app is **Coach Bear’s daily mentorship**, delivered initially through text. Each day, Coach Bear will send a personalized **text message** to the user – this could be a motivational quote, a quick challenge/task for the day, or a check-in question. The MVP will implement this as a simple **chat interface** (similar to a messaging app) where:

   * **Coach Bear’s Message:** Every morning a new **text message from Coach Bear** appears. (e.g., *“Good morning John! Today, try to take one step outside your comfort zone. You got this!”*). This can be automated from the backend on a schedule.
   * **User Responses:** The user can reply via text in the same thread. They might share how they feel or confirm they’ll take on the challenge. Coach Bear’s AI can be rudimentary at first – even a set of pre-written responses or simple rule-based replies acknowledging the user’s input (e.g., *“Proud of you for committing, keep me posted!”*) would add a lot of value. The key is the user **feels heard and guided daily**.
   * **Push Notification:** Ensure the user gets a daily push notification when Coach Bear’s message arrives, drawing them back into the app consistently.
   * *Note:* For MVP, **stick to text-only media**. Omit complex features like voice notes or video messages from Coach Bear for now. The text approach still delivers the core value of daily accountability and motivation, while being much simpler to implement.

3. **On-Demand Dating Advice with "Dr. Love" (AI Dating Coach via Text):** Besides Coach Bear, the one specialist mentor to include in MVP is the **dating coach (Dr. Love)**. This fulfills a high-value need for many users – guidance on relationships and confidence – without building the whole team of specialists yet. The implementation will be another **chat thread dedicated to Dr. Love**, where users can **ask questions or seek advice about dating and relationships** anytime. For example, a user might type, *“I have a date this Friday and I’m really nervous. Any tips?”* The Dr. Love bot can respond with helpful advice (*“Absolutely! Remember to be present and listen... Good luck!”*). Key points for MVP:

   * **Text-Based Q\&A:** Users type questions; the AI provides supportive, relevant answers in a friendly tone. We can bootstrap this with a basic FAQ-style logic or a lightweight AI model focused on dating tips.
   * **Persona & Tone:** Dr. Love should have a distinct voice – e.g., upbeat, confident, and caring – but all communication remains via text. No need for audio/video gimmicks; the value lies in the **quality of advice**.
   * By including just Coach Bear and Dr. Love, we cover two crucial domains (general life coaching and dating) without overloading the app with too many AI personas. This keeps the experience focused and manageable while still addressing a primary pain point (many users want help with dating).

4. **Brotherhood Community via Daily Zoom Calls:** To foster the sense of *brotherhood* and real human connection, the MVP will leverage **live group calls** – but instead of building complex in-app video conferencing, we simply **integrate Zoom meetings** into the experience. The idea is to have a **daily group meeting** where members can join a video call to share progress or just socialize, which is hugely valuable for accountability and camaraderie. Implementation for MVP:

   * **Schedule & Link on Dashboard:** On the main screen (or a dedicated Community section), display the **time of the next group Zoom call** and a **“Join Meeting” button**. This button opens the Zoom app or a web Zoom link directly to the meeting. For example: *“Next Brotherhood Huddle: Tonight 7:00 PM. \[Join]”*.
   * **Leverage Zoom**: Use a consistent meeting ID or a dynamic link provided by the program organizers. Since we’re not developing video chat tech from scratch, this solution is quick and reliable. It accomplishes the job of getting users face-to-face with minimal effort.
   * **Community Feel:** Even though it’s just a link, framing is key. In the app, call this out as joining your brothers in a roundtable or huddle, emphasizing that **real people** are waiting on the other side. This gives new users an immediate way to feel included in a supportive community, which is a major value proposition of The Reset Order.
   * (Other community features like member directories or direct messaging can be left for later. The daily Zoom call is the highest value community interaction to start with.)

5. **Basic Progress Tracking & Accountability:** To keep users motivated, the MVP should include a **simple way to track progress** and celebrate consistency. We don’t need a complex gamified dashboard yet – just a **clear indication of the user’s journey status**. High-value elements could be:

   * **Day Counter / Streak:** Show the user what **Day number** they are on in the program (e.g., *“Day 7 of 90”*) and/or how many consecutive days they’ve engaged. This can be as simple as a line of text on the home screen or under their profile. Seeing the day count rise gives a sense of accomplishment and forward momentum.
   * **Completed Task Checkmarks:** If daily challenges or tasks are given (from Coach Bear’s messages), allow the user to **check them off** or at least mark them as done in the chat. This could just be acknowledged in the conversation (e.g., user says "Done!" and Coach Bear responds encouragingly), which creates a loop of commitment and reward.
   * **Minimal Visuals:** We can incorporate a small progress bar or icon (like a throne symbol filling up gradually) to graphically represent progress, but keep it simple and secondary. The primary focus is that the user knows they are making progress in a tangible way.
   * These basic tracking features ensure the app isn’t just conversations in a vacuum – the user sees that it’s part of a structured journey. It adds accountability (nobody wants to break their streak) and reasons to come back daily, which are crucial for MVP success.

By concentrating on these five high-value jobs, the MVP will deliver the core experience of Coach Bear’s program:

* **Inspire users from the first launch** with a gripping yet streamlined onboarding.
* **Engage them daily** with personal coaching and challenges.
* **Provide expert advice** in a key area (dating) on demand.
* **Connect them to a supportive community** without heavy build-out, using Zoom for immediacy.
* **Encourage consistent progress** with simple tracking mechanisms.

This stripped-down feature set captures what’s truly special about The Reset Order (personal mentorship, brotherhood support, and a sense of journey) without over-engineering early on. It lays a strong foundation — we can always enrich the experience later (adding voice interactions, more AI specialists, in-app video conferencing, advanced visuals, etc.) once we’ve validated that these core jobs deliver value to our users. For now, the focus is on **executing these essentials flawlessly** in true “Jobsian” fashion: do few things, but do them exceptionally well.
