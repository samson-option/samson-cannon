# The Reset Order Emotional Directive: A Scene Generation Canon

## Core Philosophy: The Internal Landscape

**We don't tell stories – we capture emotional truths.** Every visual we create is a window into the protagonist's internal world at a precise moment in his journey. Plot is secondary; the emotional vector space is everything. 

Our scenes work like memory – not literal documentation but emotional impressions that resonate in the gut. When generating content, always ask: *What does this moment FEEL like from inside the experience?*

## Scene Generation Principles

### 1. **Emotional Selection First**
- Identify the precise emotional moment from the journey
- Feel it in your body before visualizing
- Let emotion dictate every visual choice

### 2. **Environmental Psychology**
- Spaces reflect internal states
- Architecture as emotional metaphor
- Light and shadow as mood indicators

### 3. **Subtlety Supremacy**
- Metaphors glimpsed, not displayed
- Symbols suggested in composition
- Story told through accumulation of details

### 4. **Color as Emotion**
- Warm gold → Cold blue → Absent color → Phoenix red → Full spectrum
- Saturation reflects life force
- Light quality indicates hope levels

### 5. **The Villeneuve Filter**
- Every frame could be a film still
- Composition deliberate and meaningful
- Reality elevated, not escaped
- Atmosphere as character

### 6. **Authentic Details**
- Mess realistic, not staged
- Wear patterns telling truth
- Time's passage visible
- Nothing pristine without reason

### 7. **The Male Gaze Internal**
- How he sees himself, not how others see him
- Ego wounds and victories shown honestly
- Masculine ideals examined, not performed
- Strength and vulnerability coexisting

## Implementation Guide

**When generating a scene:**

1. **Select Emotional Moment** - Which precise point in the journey?
2. **Feel the Internal State** - What does this feel like from inside?
3. **Choose Environmental Mirror** - What space reflects this feeling?
4. **Layer Subtle Motifs** - What details accumulate to tell truth?
5. **Apply Color Psychology** - Where on the spectrum of hope?
6. **Frame with Purpose** - What does composition say about power/powerlessness?
7. **Light with Intention** - How does illumination reveal internal state?

**Remember:** We're not illustrating addiction or recovery. We're capturing what it feels like to be a brilliant man watching himself fall, and what it feels like to crawl back to sovereignty. Every image should make our audience think: "How does he know exactly how this feels?"

**The Ultimate Test:** Does this image capture an emotional truth so precisely that it functions as both mirror and window - showing our audience their own experience while revealing the path forward?
