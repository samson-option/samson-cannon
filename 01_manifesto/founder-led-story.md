# A solution I had to build for myself


Here’s how we frame it:

- **The Gap in the Market:** We lead with the idea that the founder’s struggle revealed a *massive gap* in resources. It goes something like: *In trying to solve his own stimulant addiction, our founder realized the existing approaches failed people like him – high-achievers who don’t fit the typical recovery mold.* This immediately positions the founder’s tale as the **reason for innovation**, not a tale for sympathy. It says: *“I went through hell and discovered a problem that no one else was addressing – so I took matters into my own hands.”* This framing casts the founder as a proactive problem-solver.
- **From Personal to Universal:** We always bridge from the founder’s personal experience to the broader audience’s experience. For example: “What started as one guy’s mission to get his life back has grown into a playbook for thousands to do the same.” This reinforces that the story isn’t *really* about one person – it’s about a common struggle and a shared solution. We echo a narrative pattern where the founder’s story is the **first chapter** of a much larger book that is now about everyone who joins The Reset Order. The founder’s successful recovery is proof and **inspiration** that fuels the community, rather than a singular triumph to admire from afar.
- **The Founder as First User:** A useful framing is thinking of the founder as the *first customer* of the solution. They built what they needed, used it to transform themselves, and now offer it to others. This flips the script from “founder-centric” to “product- and user-centric.” Copy might say: “Our founder created The Reset Order to save his own life – and in doing so, realized it could save others.” The emphasis swiftly moves to those *others*. It’s a classic narrative device in startup storytelling: founder faces X problem, no solution existed, so they invent one, and now it’s helping everyone with X problem. This ensures the **focus remains on the value delivered**, not on the founder’s personality.
- **No Founder Worship – Just Respect for Execution:** Internally and externally, we avoid a cult of personality. The founder is portrayed as gritty and determined, but not some mythical unicorn. Any praise is tied to what they’ve *done* (“built a program that’s helping people achieve Y”) rather than inherent personal glory. This humility in framing actually **enhances** the founder’s image: they come across as mission-driven versus ego-driven. When the founder appears indispensable, it’s because of their role in the mission’s success (much like Hangman was indispensable *to the team and mission*, not for his own glory). We want audiences to think “Thank goodness for their leadership and vision” rather than “What a superstar, let’s hear more about him.” The story always boomerangs back to how the founder’s actions benefit the **member or the cause**.
- **Member as Hero, Founder as Guide:** As touched on earlier, we explicitly frame our messaging so that the member (customer) is the hero on a journey. The founder (and the whole Reset Order team) are the mentors, guides, and tool-makers that help the hero succeed. We often use second-person (“you”) in storytelling to center the audience: *“You’re the one making the hard change; we just give you the roadmap.”* Any time the narrative might start drifting too much into founder biography, we pivot with a question or statement about the **reader’s** journey. For instance, after a brief founder anecdote, we might add: “…and that’s why *you* now have access to a system that actually works in the real world.” It continuously reinforces that *the story is really about **you**, the member*.
- **Founder’s Story as Proof, Not Spotlight:** Ultimately, we treat the founder’s recovery story as *evidence* that the program works and that we understand the target user, rather than a standalone tale to marvel at. It validates the approach (“he got off Adderall and built a 7-figure business, so this must be legit”) and builds trust (“he’s one of us, he’s been through it”). We might highlight key relatable beats of that story – hitting rock bottom, trying and failing with mainstream solutions, engineering a new solution – purely to make the audience think *“That’s me. I want what he had.”* Then we immediately transition to how the brand delivers that. Any time we mention the founder’s personal win (e.g., being stimulant-free and higher-performing than ever), it’s quickly followed by an invitation or assurance that *the audience can have the same outcome*.

In summary, the narrative framing keeps the founder in an **important but supporting role**. The founder lights the torch; the customers carry it onward. This approach not only makes the brand message more empowering for the audience (they see themselves as the hero), but it also aligns with the founder’s own ethos – they **“reject the savior title”** and instead want to be the one who *enables* others to save themselves. It’s a collaborative narrative, not a one-man show.
