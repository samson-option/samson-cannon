# Enhanced Onboarding Flow and Comprehensive User Profile Schema

**Foundational Perspective – Addiction as Learned Behavior (Not a Disease):** The Reset Order’s approach to recovery starts from a unique premise. Rather than viewing addiction as a fixed chronic disease in the AA model, we see it as a **learned behavior with self-reinforcing mechanisms** that can be unlearned. In addiction, every repetition of the harmful behavior strengthens neural pathways (the “habit learning” of dopamine reward circuits) . Over time, repeated misuse of substances or addictive activities progressively **impairs the brain’s capacity for self-control and decision-making**  – essentially a diminishing of “agency.” The encouraging flip side is that this process is reversible: just as negative habits compound to deepen the addiction, positive habits can *compound* to restore freedom. Consistent daily improvements lead to exponential gains – e.g. getting just 1% better each day can make someone ~37× better in a year, whereas getting 1% worse each day can nearly take you to zero . In other words, **recovery is achieved by “winning the day,” every day**, allowing small wins to accumulate into major transformation. We also recognize that the core challenge in early recovery isn’t usually *knowing* what to do – it’s mustering the **motivation to do it**. Research confirms that recovery “comes down to motivation,” as those who sustain change are those who find the will to move toward recovery . Therefore, our entire system is built to deliver emotionally resonant, personalized messages and rituals that boost the individual’s motivation (their *“motivation vector”*), driving positive daily decisions. Finally, we emphasize a holistic reset: gradually **restoring the brain’s dopamine fitness**, **rewriting internal narratives** (from victimhood to heroism), and **optimizing the environment** to reduce triggers and encourage success. This philosophy underpins the onboarding flow and profile schema described below, ensuring they capture not just data but the **dynamically evolving story** and state of each user’s journey.

## **Onboarding UX Flow – A Mythic Journey from Day One**

The Reset Order’s onboarding is designed as an epic journey narrative that inducts the user as the hero of their own story. From the very first interaction, new users **“author their own myth”** – sharing their background, struggles, and aspirations in story form. The system transcribes and analyzes this narrative to create a rich user profile (in JSON form) that maps the user’s life to a Hero’s Journey framework and tracks key psychological and neurobiological factors (especially dopamine-related metrics). This allows highly personalized coaching and content delivery from the start. The onboarding flow consists of the following stages:

1. **Call to Adventure – Mythic Invitation:** The user is welcomed as the hero of their story, framing the program as an epic adventure. The language of the welcome screen is aspirational and story-driven: by joining The Reset Order, the user is “answering the call” to change their life. The user is invited to “begin your origin story” via an embedded Typeform (or similar) on the site. This sets a mythic tone from the outset, encouraging authenticity and excitement. The messaging makes clear that a significant journey awaits – in Hero’s Journey terms, they are about to cross the threshold into a new world.
2. **Authoring the Myth – Video Story Submission:** Through the Typeform, the user records or uploads a **video of themselves telling their story**. This open-ended narrative prompt empowers the user to speak in mythic terms about their life. Guiding prompts ensure they cover key elements of their personal myth:
    - **Origin Story:** “Tell us about yourself and what led you here – your background, and the spark that ignited your desire for change.” This elicits context about their life and the pain point that motivated them to seek help.
    - **Inner Demons:** “Describe your biggest challenges or vices – the ‘dragons’ you struggle with or the addictions that have held you back.” The user is invited to name the habits or substances that plague them (e.g. gaming addiction, alcohol, pornography, etc. – whatever their *Charybdis*, in mythic terms).
    - **Golden Self Vision:** “Who do you aspire to become once these challenges are overcome? Describe your ideal ‘golden’ self.” Here the user paints a picture of the healed, successful version of themself they yearn for – effectively defining their personal *Holy Grail* or treasure at the end of the quest.
    - **Mentors & Inspirations:** “Mention any mentors, heroes, or guiding lights (real or fictional) that inspire you or give you strength.” This can reveal archetypes or figures the user looks up to (a parent, a famous figure, a fictional hero) – useful for the system to know what style of guidance might resonate.
    - **Turning Points:** “Share any major turning points or decisions in your journey so far.” The user might talk about hitting rock bottom, making a promise, a moment of clarity, etc. – events that mark transitions in their story.
    
    By speaking in these story terms, the user is essentially authoring their own myth. This is a **powerful psychological step**: it frames their struggle as a heroic journey, not a shameful failure. The act of storytelling invests the user emotionally in the journey to come. In practical terms, the Typeform may also include a few direct questions (multiple choice or short answer) to capture any factual details not likely to emerge organically in the video. For example, it might explicitly ask about current medications or supplements (“Which of the following do you take regularly? [Adderall, SSRIs, caffeine, nicotine, etc.]”), or about certain habits (“How many hours a day do you typically spend on gaming or social media?”). It could also inquire about known **psychological diagnoses** (“Have you ever been diagnosed with any condition like ADHD, anxiety, etc.?”), and **environmental factors** (“Do you live alone or with others? Any known triggers in your daily environment?”). These supplemental questions ensure important context isn’t missed if the user didn’t mention it in their narrative.
    
3. **Transcription & Semantic Analysis:** Once the user submits their video and responses, the system goes to work **transcribing the video to text** (using an AI transcription service). The transcript, along with any written answers, is then processed by our AI semantic analysis pipeline. This analysis extracts both explicit facts and subtle cues from the user’s story:
    - **Biographical & Factual Data:** The system identifies key biographical details (e.g. age, occupation, location) if mentioned, as well as any explicit mention of **medications, supplements, or substance use habits**. For example, if the user says “I take Adderall for ADHD” or “I drink coffee every morning,” these facts are extracted and noted. Similarly, if they indicated in the form that they live with family or have certain daily routines, that data is recorded.
    - **Dopamine-Related Variables:** The user’s narrative is scanned for any references to dopamine-relevant symptoms or behaviors. If they mention things like sleep problems, focus/attention issues, intense cravings, mood swings, etc., the system notes these. Even qualitative statements are interpreted – e.g. “I can hardly focus without gaming” would imply poor baseline **attention quality** and a heavy dopamine dependency on gaming. These will later be quantified (on a 1–10 or 0–100 scale) in the profile’s dopamine_state. If the user filled a quantitative survey about these (e.g. rating their average sleep quality, attention, etc.), those values are included as well. All of this helps establish the user’s initial **“dopamine fitness”** level – essentially a sense of how dysregulated their reward system currently is.
    - **Psychological Profile Clues:** The AI also picks up on any psychological or personality factors. If the user mentioned formal diagnoses (like ADHD, anxiety, depression), those are logged under a psychological profile section. If they didn’t explicitly name any, the AI may still infer tendencies from their language and story (e.g., describing racing thoughts might hint at anxiety, describing constant boredom could hint at low dopamine or ADHD traits). Personality traits affecting recovery (impulsivity, perfectionism, introversion/extroversion, etc.) might be inferred from context or tone. These inferences are tentative, but they provide starting points for personalization. (For instance, an impulsive personality might need shorter feedback loops and more immediate rewards in the program.)
    - **Environmental Context:** The user’s story and answers are analyzed for environmental factors. The system notes **living situation** (did they mention living alone, with parents, with a spouse, etc.?) and **social support** (do they have a strong support network or are they isolated?). It also flags any stated **triggers** or high-risk situations – e.g. “I always feel the urge to drink when I’m stressed at work” would tag “stress at work” as a trigger, or “having a gaming PC in my room is my downfall” tags that as an environmental trigger. These insights populate the environmental context fields in the profile.
    - **Narrative Elements & Hero’s Journey Stage:** The AI identifies *mythic narrative elements* in the transcript. References to struggles are tagged as potential **“inner_demons”**, statements of aspiration are recognized as the **“golden_self”**, and any significant life events mentioned become **“turning_points.”** If the user spoke of someone who guides or inspires them, that might be mapped to a **mentor archetype** (for example, a user saying “my uncle saved me” might be tagged with a mentor archetype like “wise_sage” in their profile). Importantly, the system also gauges where the user currently fits in the **Hero’s Journey arc**. For instance, a newcomer full of uncertainty but ready to try might be classified in the “Call to Adventure” or **“Threshold Crossing”** stage (just embarking on change). Someone actively battling cravings and fears is likely in the **“Ordeal”** stage (in the thick of the struggle). These stage classifications will be used to tailor content – e.g. a user in an Ordeal phase will receive content labeled for that stage (intense trials, encouragement to persevere through difficulty, etc.).
    - **Emotional Tone and Coaching Style Preferences:** The user’s speaking style and reactions provide hints about what motivational approach might work best. Does the user respond with laughter and humor even when discussing difficulties (implying they might enjoy a lighter, humorous tone)? Or are they very stoic and serious (implying a more direct, “no-nonsense” tone might resonate)? Did they sound upbeat and optimistic versus defeated and skeptical? The AI notes these subtleties to initialize the user’s preference profile – for example, tagging whether a **tough-love “kick in the pants”** style or a **compassionate hand-holding** style should be primary. If the user explicitly said they appreciate humor or prefer facts, those will directly set their preferred_tone or motivation_style (story-based vs data-based, etc.). These preferences ensure that when the AI coach (e.g. Coach Bear persona) engages, it speaks in a way that *feels right* to the user.
4. **Profile Construction & Canonical Storage:** All the insights from the previous step are now compiled into the user’s **profile – a structured JSON object** that represents the user in the Reset Order system. This profile is the *single source of truth* for the user’s identity, state, and progress, and it’s stored in our “Reset Brain” knowledge base. The profile JSON contains fields covering every relevant aspect of the user, derived from the onboarding. Key components of this profile include:
    - **Basic Info and Demographics:** Under profile_data, we record basic facts like age, occupation, join date, and stated goals. For example, it might note that the user is 32 years old, works as a software engineer, and has goals such as “quit gaming addiction, improve focus and fitness.” Location and timezone are recorded too (demographics), since coaching content may be tailored to their daytime/evening or local resources.
    - **Journey Stage & Progress:** The profile’s journey_stage section situates the user within the program’s **Hero’s Journey arc**. This uses standardized stage names (e.g. "call", "ordeal", "transformation", "return"). For instance, a user who is currently struggling through withdrawals or temptation might be marked in the "ordeal" stage. We also log how many days they’ve been in this stage and what the **current program or track** is (e.g. "dopamine_fitness" module if they’re focused on rebuilding dopamine health). Progress metrics such as days_sober (or days on streak for whatever habit they’re addressing) and any milestones achieved are tracked here as well. This gives a snapshot of where they are in their quest and how far they’ve come.
    - **Psychological, Neurobiological & Environmental Context:** A dedicated section (let’s call it context_profile) stores the deeper diagnostic and context data about the user. Under **psychological**, we list any known diagnoses (e.g. ADHD, anxiety) and key personality traits that could influence their recovery (for example, high impulsivity or a perfectionist streak). Under **neurobiological**, we capture things like the user’s baseline dopamine functioning or any neurochemical indicators (if known or estimated). We also explicitly list **medications or neuroactive supplements** the user uses (e.g. medications: ["Adderall"], supplements: ["Omega-3", "Magnesium"]) as well as **other dopamine-impacting inputs** like caffeine, nicotine, or frequent social media usage. These factors are important for coaches or the AI to keep in mind (for example, if a user is on Adderall, their coach might approach focus issues differently, or if they drink 5 cups of coffee a day, that’s relevant to their anxiety levels). The **environmental** sub-section documents the user’s living and support situation – e.g. whether they live alone or with family (livingSituation), what their known **triggers** are in their environment, and what their support network looks like. If, say, the user lives with a partner who still uses the addictive substance (a potentially negative environment), or conversely has a very supportive family, that context is noted. Triggers might include specific places, times, or events (for instance, “being home alone on Friday nights” or “work stress on deadlines” could be listed in identified_triggers). The support network description might note if they have supportive friends, are part of a community, or feel isolated. This comprehensive context profile ensures the **whole person** is represented – not just their usage stats, but their mind, brain, and surroundings.
    - **Dopaminergic Profile & State:** We maintain an up-to-date snapshot of the user’s dopamine-related state in the profile. There are a few facets to this:
        - **Static Profile vs. Real-Time State:** Some dopamine info is relatively static (or slowly changing), like what substances they use or baseline traits, which we captured above. But there are also dynamic state variables that change day-to-day. In a dopamine_state (or combined real_time_state) section, we store the user’s current subjective and objective state related to dopamine and motivation. This includes things like current **craving intensity**, **attention/focus quality**, **sleep quality**, and **mood**, typically on a numeric scale or simple scale (e.g. 1–10 or low/medium/high). These might come from daily check-ins or inferred from behavior (for example, if the user consistently opens the app at 3 AM, we might guess poor sleep quality).
        - **Dopamine Fitness Score:** We also compute a composite **dopamine_fitness** score – essentially a metric of how healthy and regulated their dopamine system is at the moment. Early on, this might be low (indicating high dysregulation), but as the user progresses through healthy habits, this score improves. It’s analogous to a “fitness score” but for one’s neurotransmitter system. For instance, a user who is 2 weeks sober, exercising, and sleeping better might go from a dopamine fitness of 40/100 to 60/100. This score is updated in real-time and provides a quick indicator of progress in healing the brain’s reward pathways.
        - **Motivation & Relapse Risk:** Since motivation is so critical, we include a motivation_readiness metric – how ready and energized the user currently feels to tackle challenges – and a relapse_risk level which the system can estimate based on various signals (e.g. if craving is high, sleep is poor, and the user had a recent stressor, relapse risk might be set to “high” for that day). These dynamic variables allow the system to adjust its approach proactively (for example, if motivation_readiness is low today, the AI might send an extra encouraging message or a reminder of their “golden self” vision to boost their spirits).
    - **Narrative Identity:** The profile stores distilled elements of the user’s personal myth under narrative_identity. This includes:
        - An **origin_story** summary – a short recap of how the user described their background and what led them to seek change (e.g. “Grew up shy and found solace in video games; now seeking real-life connection and adventure”).
        - Their named **inner_demons** – the key struggles they described, phrased in their terms. For example: ["procrastination", "social anxiety"] or maybe a metaphor like “the dragon of heroin” if the user used symbolic language. We keep the words they used where possible, to later echo those back (it’s powerful for the user to see the system referencing the exact “dragon” they spoke of).
        - Their **golden_self** – a description of who they want to become (e.g. “a disciplined, confident leader with a balanced life”). This is essentially their envisioned *heroic identity* to strive toward.
        - Important **turning_points** they mentioned – stored as a list of key events/decisions (for example: “health scare in 2022 prompted me to quit drinking” or “missed my daughter’s graduation due to my addiction – realized I need to change”). These help the system remind the user of their own pivotal moments (“remember when you decided ‘no more’ after that incident – you’ve come far.”).
        - Any **mentor_archetypes** that fit the influences they cited. We have a taxonomy of archetypes (mentor figures could be “sage_guide” for a wise old mentor, “brotherhood_support” for peer support, etc.). If the user mentioned, say, a supportive friend group or an inspiring podcast host, we map those to archetypes. This can later guide what kind of stories or quotes we present – e.g. if they resonate with a “sage” archetype, the coach might share proverb-like wisdom; if they resonate with “brotherhood,” the tone might be more camaraderie-driven.
        - **Archetype Alignment:** In addition, the system can optionally match the user to a **Recovery Archetype** from our program’s framework (our “target_customers” archetypes defined in the foundation layer). These archetypes, like “The Overworked Exec” or others we’ve identified, come with typical Achilles’ heels, fears (shadows), and preferred coping vices. If the user strongly fits one, the profile can note an archetype tag (e.g. Overworked Exec) and even import some of those insights (for instance, an overworked exec’s Achilles heel might be work stress and fear of failure, with charybdis (vice) of choice being Adderall or alcohol). This adds another layer of personalization – content can be tailored not only to the user’s personal story but also to the known patterns of their archetype group.
    - **Preferences for Coaching:** Under preferences, we store the user’s stated or inferred preferences for how they like to be coached:
        - **Tone:** Whether they prefer a tough-love **“incendiary”** tone, a gentle **“compassionate”** tone, or perhaps a **“humorous”** approach. For example, some users might get fired up by a drill-sergeant style challenge, whereas others would shut down and need an encouraging, empathetic voice.
        - **Motivation Style:** Do they respond more to hard data and scientific explanations, or to stories and analogies? This might be "data_driven" vs "story_based" (in the JSON we represented it as motivation_style). Many users find inspiration in narrative (which is why our whole approach is mythic), but some analytical types might love seeing charts of their progress or citations to studies about recovery – we’ll cater to that if we know it.
        - **Humor Tolerance:** Simply a flag if it’s okay to throw in playful banter or memes, or if the user prefers to keep communications serious and on-topic.
        - **Communication Frequency:** How often the user wants check-ins or new content. For example, some might want interaction daily, others might prefer a lighter touch like weekly summaries. This could be "daily", "weekly", etc., and helps modulate the cadence of messaging so we don’t annoy or lose the user.
        - **Preferred Address:** How the user likes to be addressed – perhaps they chose a moniker or just their first name, or even a title like “Brother”. In our mythic context, some users might enjoy being called “warrior” or “hero” playfully. If they indicate a preference (“call me John” or “I like being called bro!”), we store that.
    - **Onboarding Transcript:** We attach the full **onboarding transcript text** (and possibly the video URL if stored) to the profile (onboarding_transcript). This preserves the user’s exact words and story. Not only is this a rich context for the AI to reference later, it’s also symbolically important: the user’s *own voice* becomes part of the system’s knowledge. At any point, the AI can pull direct quotes or revisit the original narrative to ensure continuity. For instance, if the user later feels hopeless, the coach AI might literally quote something uplifting they said in their origin story to remind them of their initial hope.
    - **Coach Notes and Journal:** As coaching interactions begin (even during onboarding if a live coach reviews the submission), we maintain a coach_notes log. Each note has a timestamp, an author (which could be the AI coach persona or a human coach), and a category/tag. Notes record significant observations, progress, or incidents. For example, after the user’s first week, Coach Bear might add a note: “2025-07-07 – **Struggle:** User reported strong cravings over the weekend but resisted relapse.” Another might be “**Goal:** Completed 30-day detox challenge, huge milestone!” Over time this becomes a narrative journal of the user’s journey. It’s very useful for any coach or AI intervention to quickly scan recent notes (e.g. to see if there’s a pattern of weekend struggles, or to recall what was discussed in the last session). It also feeds into the personalization; the system can congratulate the user on things recorded in notes or follow up on struggles they had.
    - **Contextual Triggers:** The profile includes a list of context_triggers which define **if-then rules or conditions** tied to the user’s state or timeline. These are used to automate the support. For example, a trigger might be defined as: *If* the user reaches 7 days in the “ordeal” stage *then* send_congratulatory_message. Or if the user’s relapse_risk stays high for 3 days straight, trigger an alert for a coach to intervene. Each trigger has a condition, an action, and an “active” flag. This mechanism operationalizes the profile data – ensuring that changes in the profile lead to timely reactions from the system. It’s part of what makes the coaching **adaptive** rather than static.
    - **Personalization Tokens:** For convenience in content generation, we store a few quick access tokens like the user’s first name, chosen hero title, etc., under personalization_tokens. For example, "first_name": "John", and perhaps a special title like "hero_title": "Warrior of Focus" that the system bestowed based on their story. These tokens can be inserted into message templates easily (“Hello **Warrior of Focus**,” etc.), maintaining a personal touch.
    - **Signature (Semantic Tags):** We generate a compact **signature string** that encapsulates key aspects of the user’s profile in a tag-like format (much like content pieces in our system have signature tags). For instance, a signature might look like: "[voice:coach_bear] [journey_stage:ordeal] [program_method:dopamine_fitness] [tone:mythic]". This example indicates the user is in the Ordeal stage of the Dopamine Fitness program, and suggests the coaching voice and an overall mythic tone should be used. The signature is stored for quick reference and is used in our vector database to semantically link the user to content that has matching tags. Essentially, it’s a shorthand for the user’s current state and the appropriate style of engagement.
    - **Timestamps:** Finally, we keep last_interaction, created_at, and updated_at timestamps to track recency of activity and profile updates. Every time something significant changes in the profile (e.g. stage advancement, new note added), we update the updated_at. This helps in querying active vs. idle users, and can be used for things like re-engagement campaigns (“We haven’t seen you in a while, hero, where have you gone?” if no interaction in X days).
    
    The resulting JSON profile is then **persisted in the Reset Brain knowledge base**. Concretely, it’s stored in two forms for maximal utility:
    
    - **Vector Index (Semantic Memory):** We embed the textual parts of the profile (especially the narrative portions like origin_story, transcript, notes) into vector representations and store them in a Pinecone (or similar) vector index. This allows semantic searches against user profiles. For example, if the AI is generating advice about “overcoming procrastination” for a user, it can semantically search within that user’s own profile/story for relevant snippets (maybe the user said something about procrastination in their transcript) to ground the advice. Or, the system could even search across profiles to find similar cases (to draw analogies or success stories).
    - **Relational/Document Database (Structured Memory):** We also store the profile JSON in a Postgres (or other JSON-capable) database. This makes it easy to query specific fields or do analytics. For instance, we can quickly filter “all users currently in Ordeal stage who have relapse_risk = high” or “all users whose primary vice (charybdis) is alcohol” for targeted interventions or to find appropriate group support. The structured store is also what the real-time app logic uses to check those context_triggers and update status (for example, increment days_sober counter daily, or reset it if a relapse is recorded).
    
    By the end of this step, we have a **canonical user profile** saved – a 360° view of the hero and their journey so far. It’s now a first-class piece of the Reset Order’s knowledge, ready to be used by the coaching engine.
    
5. **Personalized Journey Kick-off:** With the profile in place, the user is now officially “in the system” and the onboarding flow transitions into their first personalized interaction. This is where we **reflect their myth back to them** to show we heard them and to stoke their motivation for the road ahead. Often, the AI (speaking in the voice of our head coach persona, e.g. *Coach Bear*) will present a **“Hero’s Profile”** summary to the user. This could be a stylized overview that highlights the epic elements of their story: e.g. *“Welcome, **Warrior of Focus**! You have answered the call to adventure. We’ve heard your origin: from shy kid to software engineer seeking purpose, sparked by that health scare that shook you awake. We know the dragons you face – the lure of the screen, the fear of social judgement – and we see the golden self you yearn to become: a confident, disciplined leader living boldly. You stand now at the Threshold, about to battle through the Ordeal. Fear not – you are not alone. We, your allies and mentors, are here to guide you through each trial.”* This kind of message weaves the user’s own words (origin story, inner demons, golden vision) into a motivational narrative. It serves two purposes: **validation** (the user feels truly seen and understood) and **inspiration** (their mundane personal details have been cast into a heroic mold, which is empowering).
    
    From here, The Reset Order platform immediately begins delivering **personalized content and challenges** tailored to the user’s unique profile. Because we know each user’s specific dopamine profile, context, and stage, we can choose the most relevant starting point instead of a one-size-fits-all curriculum. For example, suppose our new user “John” revealed a serious social media and gaming compulsion, with high craving intensities in the evenings. The very first piece of content might be a **“Digital Detox Starter Kit”**, specifically addressing screen-based dopamine habits. Alongside, Coach Bear might send a message like, *“John, to weaken that dragon of distraction, your first quest is a 7-day digital detox challenge. We’ve equipped you with a guide on how to do it – including tips on phone-free bedtime and rekindling offline hobbies. This is your first trial by fire, but remember why you’re doing this – ‘to become the disciplined, confident leader’ you spoke of. Let’s slay this one, warrior!”* The content and tone here are chosen because of what we gleaned: he’s in Ordeal (so it’s framed as a trial), his demon is procrastination via screens (so solution is a detox), his golden self is disciplined (so we remind him of that goal), and his tone preference might be “incendiary” with a bit of brotherly encouragement (so Coach Bear speaks like a tough but caring comrade).
    
    As the user engages with this first challenge, the system will track their progress and update the profile accordingly (e.g. marking the **directive** of “7-day detox” as in-progress or completed in their profile’s directives list, updating streak counts, etc.). The journey officially kicks off, and **every interaction going forward will draw upon the profile** to maintain narrative continuity. Future exercises, lessons, or messages will keep referencing the mythic elements the user provided (“Remember how you described feeling exiled like a lone wolf? This week, your quest is to start reconnecting – find a ‘pack’ that supports the new you…”). In essence, the user’s onboarding story becomes the backbone of an ongoing personalized coaching narrative. The hero has answered the call; now the real adventure begins, with their profile serving as the evolving map and guide.
    

## **Proposed Comprehensive User Profile Schema**

## **(JSON Format)**

Bringing together all the above, below is a **JSON schema** for the user profile that captures the rich detail from onboarding and supports ongoing updates. This schema is designed to encompass the **mythic narrative** elements *and* the **contextual psychological/neurobiological** factors, in alignment with our understanding of addiction and recovery. It is also structured to integrate with the Reset Order’s content engine (using tags and references for personalization) and to evolve over time as the user progresses.

**Schema Highlights & Key Features:**

- **Holistic User Context (Psychological, Neurobio, Environmental):** The profile now captures a 360° diagnostic view of the user. In context_profile, we document **psychological factors** (any mental health diagnoses like ADHD, core personality traits like impulsivity or neuroticism) and **neurobiological factors** (dopamine baseline level, medications, supplements, caffeine/nicotine use, etc.). We also capture the user’s **environmental context** – their living situation, identified triggers, and support network. This is crucial because addiction doesn’t exist in a vacuum: knowing a user’s context (e.g. they live alone with easy internet access, or they live with parents who monitor them, etc.) helps tailor the approach. It also aligns with our belief that environment design is key to recovery (we help users set up surroundings for success). By structuring these under the profile, coaches and algorithms can easily query, for example, who has “benzos” as a vice or who lacks a support network, and adjust interventions accordingly.
- **Hero’s Journey Mapping:** The profile explicitly situates the user in the **Hero’s Journey** framework via the journey_stage. This uses a controlled vocabulary of stages (e.g., "call", "threshold", "ordeal", "rebirth", "return"). At onboarding, we make an initial best-fit assignment (many will start at “Call” or “Threshold Crossing” when they first commit to change). As they progress, this stage is updated to reflect their narrative arc in the program. For instance, after sustaining some success, they might move into a “Transformation” stage (they’re experiencing change), and eventually “Return” (where they solidify gains and perhaps help others). We also track how long they’ve been in the current stage (days_in_stage) which can be a trigger for content (e.g. if someone has been in Ordeal for a very long time, perhaps they are stuck and need an intervention to push them forward). The current_program field notes which specific Reset Order program or track they are following (since The Reset Order might have sub-programs, e.g. a Dopamine Fitness 30-day reset, or a specific Alcohol Recovery track). The **progress_metrics** allow numeric tracking of their journey progress: days sober (or days without the target behavior), streak counts for habits, and any major milestones achieved. These mirror things users often count in recovery (like “I’ve been 14 days clean!”). Including them in the profile means the system can readily congratulate achievements or detect setbacks (if days_sober resets to 0, a relapse occurred). In essence, the journey_stage section anchors the user’s story in our standardized journey map, which helps us align them with appropriately staged content and see at a glance “where” they are in their quest.
- **Mythic Narrative Constructs:** The narrative_identity portion of the profile stores the **mythic story elements** that the user provided, which is a distinguishing feature of our approach. Rather than a dry intake form, we have *narrative fields* like origin_story, inner_demons, golden_self, etc., which hold the user’s own descriptions of themselves in story form. This mapping of the user’s life to mythic archetypes serves multiple purposes. First, it reinforces to the user that *their story matters* and is the foundation of the program – we’re not imposing an external narrative, we’re using *their* narrative. Second, it allows the AI coach to keep referencing these personal mythic elements to maintain **continuity and motivation**. For example, if a user’s golden self is “a present, loving father,” the coach will remind them of that identity whenever they feel down (“Each day without alcohol, you’re becoming that present, loving father you vowed to be”). The mentor_archetypes field further personalizes the mythic framework: it identifies what kinds of support figures resonate with the user. If a user really connected with the idea of a “brotherhood” of peers, the coach might say “your fellow warriors in this brotherhood are with you.” If they looked up to a certain figure, the coach might reference wisdom from that figure. Additionally, by incorporating **Archetype Alignment** (connecting to predefined archetypes from our target_customers research), the profile gains an extra layer of insight. For example, if John matches “The Lost Gamer” archetype (hypothetically), and we know common traits of that archetype (e.g. Achilles heel: escapism due to social anxiety, Shadow fear: “I’ll never be good enough in real life”, Charybdis: endless gaming), we can use those in coaching. The profile could list those under narrative or psychological sections, or simply tag the archetype name for reference. This way, we leverage patterns seen in similar heroes’ journeys while still treating John as a unique individual.
- **Dopaminergic Profile & Dynamic State:** A major focus of our schema is capturing the **state of the user’s dopamine system and related behaviors**, since our program specifically targets dopamine dysregulation. The profile has fields for **medications and substances** affecting dopamine (from ADHD meds to caffeine), and tracks self-reported metrics like craving levels or attention quality. We’ve introduced the concept of a **“dopamine_fitness” score** – an aggregate indicator of how balanced their dopamine system is, on a scale (e.g. 0–100). This might be calculated from several inputs (sleep, mood, cravings, etc.) or adjusted as they hit milestones (like each week of abstinence could bump it up). The profile also tracks **motivation_readiness** (which might correspond to something like their Stage of Change, or simply a current motivation level from 1–10) and an estimated **relapse_risk** (low/medium/high). These dynamic fields are updated regularly (even daily) based on user check-ins or observed behavior. This design reflects our stance that addiction is not a static label but a fluid state that can improve or worsen day by day. By quantifying these aspects, the system can personalize in real-time – e.g., if someone’s dopamine_fitness is still very low, we know they might need simpler tasks and quick wins early on. If their motivation is dipping, we might switch to more inspirational messaging that day. In summary, the profile doesn’t just capture who the user *was* at onboarding; it actively tracks how they *are right now*, allowing the AI to meet them where they are. It’s worth noting that these numeric scores also allow the user (and coaches) to **visualize progress**. Over months, a user might see their dopamine_fitness climb and their relapse_risk indicators go from “high” to “low” – a concrete reflection of healing which can boost morale.
- **Preferences and Personalization Settings:** The profile’s preferences section ensures that the *style* of coaching is tailored to the individual. This is something often overlooked in recovery programs – one size does not fit all when it comes to communication. By storing their preferred tone, style, and even things like humor tolerance, the AI can adjust its language accordingly. For instance, two users might get the same type of content about “urge surfing” (a technique to handle cravings), but for one user it might be delivered as a stern challenge (“Enough running, face the urge head-on!”) and for another as gentle encouragement (“It’s okay to feel that pull; let’s breathe through it together”). These nuances can be the difference between a message that lands and one that alienates. Also, the communication_frequency helps prevent fatigue – if John said weekly is enough, we won’t pester him daily (conversely, someone who wants daily accountability can get that). All these preference toggles feed into how the Reset Brain formulates its outreach, making the user experience feel **bespoke**. It’s like having a coach who really knows your personality – because in effect, we’ve briefed the AI with these details.
- **Directives – Personalized Actions and Rituals:** Beyond capturing user state, the schema also includes an array of directives. These are **active intervention assignments** given to the user – in plain terms, the habits, exercises, or boundaries we prescribe as part of their recovery plan. Each directive has an id, a type (we categorize them as “action” for one-time tasks, “ritual” for routine habits, or “boundary” for rules like “no phone after 10pm”), a description, a frequency if applicable (e.g. daily, weekly, or triggered by an event), and a current status (pending, in-progress, completed, etc.). For example, a boundary-type directive might be “No alcohol in the house – remove all bottles” with a one-time action; a ritual might be “Morning sunlight walk” to do every day; an action might be “Attend one support group meeting” this week. These directives operationalize the advice into concrete steps. By storing them in the profile, the system can keep track of what it has asked the user to do and their compliance/progress. They essentially form a **personalized recovery plan**. Moreover, each directive links to a related_doctrine_id referencing our knowledge base of core principles (the “doctrine”). For instance, if we give a “dopamine fasting” challenge, it will link to the concept of “Dopamine Fasting” in our knowledge base (Layer: Brain). If we ask them to create a morning ritual, that links to our principle about “Aura/Morning Rituals”. This linkage means the system can, at any time, explain *why* a directive matters (by pulling in the doctrine’s explanation), and it ensures that every assigned task is grounded in our overall methodology. It also helps in analysis – we can see which doctrines a user has engaged with by looking at their directives.
- **Coach Notes & Ongoing Journal:** The coach_notes in the profile serve as a running log of the user’s journey from the coach’s perspective. Every significant event or observation can be noted here, categorized by type (goal, struggle, insight, etc.). For example, if the user slips (relapse), a note would be added; if they have a big win, another note. This running narrative is incredibly useful for **continuity**: the next time the AI or a human coach interacts with the user, they can quickly recall “what happened recently.” It prevents the user from having to repeat themselves and allows tailored follow-ups (“Last week you mentioned trouble sleeping – how is that going now?”). Over time, these notes also let us analyze patterns (e.g. every note marked “struggle” happens on a weekend – indicating weekends are risky for this user). Storing notes in the profile (instead of siloed in a separate system) means the AI assistant can actually read them and incorporate that knowledge into its responses. For instance, if a note says the user’s mother is sick (life stressor), the AI can show empathy or avoid pushing too hard that week. Essentially, coach_notes turn the profile into a **living document** of the journey, not just a static snapshot from onboarding. They complement the user’s own narrative with the coach’s perspective.
- **Semantic Signature & Content Cross-Referencing:** The signature field in the profile is a compact string of tags that summarize key dimensions of the user’s current state and context. This mirrors the way content in our system is tagged. For example, a content piece (say an inspirational story) might be tagged [journey_stage:ordeal] [topic:focus] [tone:incendiary]. Because the user’s profile has a similar signature, our content recommendation engine can do a direct matching: find pieces where tags align with the user’s tags (stage, tone preference, etc.). The signature in the example JSON shows [voice:coach_bear] (indicating the coaching persona to use for this user), [journey_stage:ordeal] (they are in the ordeal phase), [program_method:dopamine_fitness] (the program methodology currently relevant), and [tone:mythic] (suggesting that communications should maintain a mythic flair). The tagging system can be extended – for instance, we might add [archetype:lost_gamer] if using archetypes, or [diagnosis:ADHD] if we want content specific to that condition. The **power of this semantic approach** is that it enables both automated retrieval of relevant content and easier prompt engineering for generative AI. When generating a message, we can feed the LLM the user’s signature to prompt it to adopt the correct voice and context. When searching our library of articles, we can query by tags to narrow things down (find all content suitable for someone in Ordeal stage working on dopamine issues). This ensures consistency: the user gets content and advice that “fits” their story and stage, making it feel eerily personalized (because it is!).
- **Support for Evolution and Dynamic Updates:** The schema is designed to be **evolved over time** as the user grows. Fields like last_interaction and updated_at help timestamp changes. Many parts of the profile are meant to change: e.g., journey_stage.stage will be updated when the user moves to the next phase of their journey; days_in_stage resets at that point. The progress_metrics will update maybe daily (increment streaks or days sober) and get new entries in milestones_achieved as the user hits significant checkpoints (like “90 days sober” or “completed program X”). The real_time_state is essentially continuously updated – cravings, mood, motivation can fluctuate daily, and we capture those changes via user input or sensor data. Even the narrative_identity could be appended to – new turning points can be added if the user shares a new story later, and their concept of their golden self might evolve (perhaps we’d update it after a major breakthrough conversation). The profile can also absorb new data from other sources: e.g., if the user connects a wearable that tracks sleep, we could update sleep_quality automatically each week. In practice, we’ll likely version-control or log certain changes (especially stage transitions or big events) either via additional note entries or an audit log, so we don’t lose historical info. But the main idea is that the profile is a **living profile**. This allows the coaching to maintain narrative continuity (“Three months ago you struggled to go one day without gaming, and now you’ve gone 90 days – the tide has turned!” referencing the past state vs current). The schema’s flexibility (with sub-objects and arrays) allows adding more fields if needed without major overhauls – for example, if we later decide to track a “social connection score” or something, we can drop it into real_time_state or context_profile. It’s built to grow with our understanding of recovery.
- **Integration with Reset Order’s Knowledge Architecture:** It’s worth noting that this user profile schema is intentionally aligned with the broader architecture of our “Reset Brain.” The doctrine_references linking to knowledge concepts, the signature tags corresponding to content taxonomy, and the use of similar structures (like how directives reference doctrine_id analogous to how content pieces reference those same doctrine IDs) all ensure that our **user data and content library speak the same language**. For example, our knowledge base might have a doctrine principle about “Dopamine Dysregulation” with ID brain_dopamine_fast which explains why dopamine fasting helps – the user’s directive is linked to that, so the AI can pull in an explanation or success statistics from that doctrine when encouraging the user (“Science shows that doing a dopamine fast can restore dopamine receptors, which improves your ability to enjoy simple pleasures again .”). This tight integration makes our system truly **prescriptive and explanatory**: we don’t just tell the user what to do, we can seamlessly remind them of the “why” grounded in our core philosophy. It also means our analytics can connect the dots – e.g., see which doctrines (strategies) are being employed most for which archetypes of users, and how effective they are (closing the feedback loop to improve the program).

**Strategic Rationale – Why This Schema Elevates Personalization and Recovery Outcomes:**

Our ultimate goal with this mythic onboarding and comprehensive profile is to create a **personalized, adaptive coaching experience** that deeply resonates with each user, addressing the true nature of addiction as we see it. Here’s how the design achieves that:

- **Differentiated Model Drives Different Data:** Because we treat addiction as a *dynamic, learned behavior* rather than a static disease, the data we collect and focus on is different from traditional rehab intakes. We aren’t just slapping a label on someone (“alcoholic, in denial, needs 12-step”). Instead, we’re capturing granular metrics of their daily state and the **drivers of behavior (dopamine levels, triggers, etc.)**. This lets us tackle the problem on two fronts: *biologically*, by tracking and improving dopamine fitness, and *psychologically*, by rewriting the narrative and boosting motivation. For instance, mainstream programs might not bother to measure something like “motivation_readiness” – but we do, because motivating the user each day is central to our approach (and indeed, motivation is a predictor of who succeeds in recovery ). We explicitly engineer the profile to keep us informed if motivation drops or if the user’s environment is working against them. This means our interventions can be **faster and more precisely targeted** than a generic program. In short, the schema encodes our unique hypothesis: that recovery is a daily practice of building habits and motivation, much like physical training. By tracking those daily “reps” (and the factors influencing them), we embody our belief that *what gets measured gets improved*.
- **Deep Personalization at Scale:** The richness of the profile enables a level of personalization akin to one-on-one therapy or coaching, but delivered through AI and automation. Each user effectively has a “dossier” that the AI consults before doing anything. When the user asks a question or interacts with our system, their profile (or relevant portions) is fetched from the vector index to give context to the AI. This means the AI’s responses can reference the user’s own life (“As you mentioned in your story, losing your brother’s trust was your wake-up call. Remember that when you feel tempted – you’re fighting to never feel that regret again.”). Such tailoring is incredibly impactful: the user feels *seen* and thus trusts the program more. It’s not generic advice; it’s **“advice for John.”** Additionally, by having multiple dimensions (narrative, stage, state, preferences), we ensure content is the right **fit** on multiple levels. For example, two users might both be in Ordeal stage with alcohol addiction, but one is a young extroverted male who likes humor, and the other is an older introverted female who prefers gentle support – our system would present different tones, perhaps different story analogies, maybe even different medium (one might like video clips, the other articles) based on their profile. This kind of fine-tuned personalization has been historically only possible with an attentive human coach; our schema makes it possible with AI by encoding everything that a coach would try to remember about a client. Over time, this should translate to better outcomes, as users stick with a program that “gets me” and addresses their needs.
- **Narrative Continuity and Engagement:** By onboarding in a narrative way and keeping that narrative thread throughout the profile, we avoid a common pitfall in digital health tools: lack of emotional engagement. Many apps feel clinical or mechanical. In contrast, we place the user at the center of an evolving story. The profile’s narrative fields ensure that the *language* of the user’s journey stays consistent. The hero metaphors, the user’s own chosen symbols and phrases, are continuously reflected back. This not only makes the experience more **engaging and even fun** (it gamifies and mythologizes recovery), but it’s also psychologically powerful. The user is gradually shifting their identity – from someone who “has a problem” to a hero on a quest. Identity change is key in overcoming addiction (“I am becoming a healthy person” vs “I am a junkie trying not to use”) . Our system reinforces the positive identity by referring to the user as the hero, celebrating their milestones as heroic victories, and even treating relapses as “setbacks on the hero’s journey” rather than failures. All of this is possible because the profile provides the story framework to do so. Moreover, narrative continuity helps with **retention** – the user is more likely to come back if they feel they’re in the middle of a compelling story (their own). Each interaction feels like the next episode in a personalized saga, rather than a repetitive tip or generic lesson.
- **Coaching Intelligence & Adaptivity:** The comprehensive profile allows the AI coach (and any human coaches supervising) to be **proactive and intelligent in interventions**. The inclusion of real-time state metrics and context triggers is akin to having a monitoring dashboard for each user’s well-being. For example, suppose our user John’s relapse_risk flips to “high” because he reported high cravings and poor sleep for several days. A context trigger fires and prompts Coach Bear to reach out preemptively: “Hey brother, I noticed the past week has been rough – the dragon is thrashing, eh? Let’s double down on your morning ritual and add a check-in each evening. You’ve come too far to slip now.” This might happen **before** John even asks for help, potentially preventing a relapse. Traditional programs often react after a slip; our aim is to anticipate and mitigate in real-time. Similarly, if John’s motivation_readiness plummets, the system might adjust by giving more encouraging, easy wins (rather than overwhelming tasks). The directives list in the profile also helps adapt coaching: it ensures we don’t overload the user (we can see all active directives and hold off on new ones if they have too much on their plate), and it allows the coach to follow up specifically (“How is the no-screens-after-9pm challenge going? I see it’s still in progress – any difficulties?”). The profile basically gives the AI **contextual memory** and situational awareness. Contrast this with a typical chatbot that has no long-term memory of the user – ours effectively “remembers” everything important and uses it. Furthermore, by logging coach_notes and analyzing them, the system can learn over time. For instance, if notes show John struggles every time he visits his hometown (a pattern appears in notes), the coach can be ready next time (“You’re visiting home next week – that’s been a challenge before, so let’s plan for it.”). The intelligence is in the data: we’ve made sure the profile stores the right data to enable these adaptive strategies.
- **Content Targeting and Consistency:** The schema’s alignment with our content engine means we can deliver the **right content at the right time** with minimal friction. Because each user profile is richly tagged (stage, preferences, archetype, etc.), and our content is similarly tagged, matching them is straightforward. For example, if we have an article about “Confronting the Dragon of Procrastination” tagged for the Ordeal stage and relevant to the inner demon procrastination, the system can pick it out specifically for John when needed. The doctrine_references ensure that even the on-the-fly AI-generated advice stays consistent with our core principles. The coach might say “As you practice your morning sunlight walks, you’re actually increasing your dopamine sensitivity – it’s science, not just fluff .” The reference to doctrine id brain_dopamine_fast in the directive allows the AI to easily pull a snippet of explanation or evidence for why we assigned that habit. This keeps the messaging **educational and credible**, which can enhance the user’s buy-in (“They’re telling me to do this for a good reason, not arbitrarily.”). Moreover, if multiple team members or different AI models are contributing (say a human coach plus the AI assistant), the profile and doctrine references act as a source of truth to keep everyone on the same page. The human coach can review the profile before a call and instantly know the user’s background and what they’ve been working on, and they can add notes that the AI will see – creating a seamless hybrid coaching experience. Ultimately, the content delivered feels *tailor-made* and timely, which can dramatically increase its impact. The user might think “Wow, that story they sent me about the warrior who left his sword (phone) behind at night – it was exactly what I needed to hear today,” not realizing it was the result of a carefully engineered schema and tagging system behind the scenes.

In summary, the enhanced onboarding flow and profile schema transform a user’s personal story and context into **actionable, structured data** that our Reset Brain can use to drive truly individualized recovery coaching. We treat the user as the hero of a story – one that we help them write and rewrite – and we back it with rigorous tracking of the factors that influence habit change (dopamine levels, triggers, etc.). This approach allows us to address addiction in a way that’s aligned with our core belief: that **addiction is not an immutable disease but a maladaptive cycle that can be broken through daily, motivated effort**. By mythologizing the journey, we keep it engaging; by quantifying the journey, we keep it effective. The profile is the nexus of those two – it’s where soul meets data, so to speak. With this comprehensive schema, The Reset Order’s system can provide support that is at once **deeply empathetic and story-driven**, and **scientifically informed and personalized** – ultimately guiding each user to become “the hero of their own life” and achieve lasting recovery, one day at a time.
