# Samson Cannon: The Knowledge Engine

> **"We exist to move people from chaos to order. Our work restores personal sovereignty."**

Welcome to the **Samson Cannon**, the central knowledge repository and strategic brain for **Soft Reset**. This repository houses the DNA of our startup—from our deepest philosophical beliefs to the practical mechanics of our code and brand voice.

It is the single source of truth for *why* we build, *what* we build, and *how* we build it.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### [01_manifesto](./01_manifesto/)
**The Soul of the Company.**
Here lies the foundational "why". We reject the status quo of addiction treatment (often stuck in 1935) and propose a new path based on **Identity Reinvention** and **Sovereignty**.
*   **Key Docs:** `mission.md`, `culture.md`, `the-problem.md`
*   **Core Belief:** Recovery is not about eternal sickness; it is about **reconnection**—to self, to others, and to purpose.

### [02_solution](./02_solution/)
**The Product: Soft Reset.**
Detailed breakdowns of our program for high-achieving men trapped in stimulant dependence loops.
*   **The Framework:** A phased journey from the **Dopamine Frontier Protocol** (stabilization) to **Sovereign Independence**.
*   **The Engine:** The **Behavior Change Loop** (Reflect → Act → Reward → Repeat).
*   **The AI:** Specs for **Coach Bear** (Grounded Protector) and **Dr. Love** (Clinical Wisdom).
*   **Philosophy:** Deep dives into "Recovery as Reconnection" and why standard solutions fail.

### [03_brand](./03_brand/)
**The Voice & Visuals.**
How we communicate with the world. Our identity is a fusion of "steel and warmth"—blunt truth delivered with deep respect.
*   **Voice DNA:** The interplay between the irreverent truth-teller (**Pablo**) and the calm mentor (**Coach Bear**).
*   **Visuals:** Cinematic, dark, high-contrast, masculine, and dignified.

### [04_implementation](./04_implementation/)
**The Build.**
Technical and UX documentation for turning our philosophy into software.
*   **UX:** Onboarding flows and user experience designs.
*   **Personas Pipeline:** The technical architecture for our AI personas, including scrubbing, analysis, and "Character Bibles".

### [05_research](./05_research/)
**The Science.**
The evidence base for our approach.
*   **Topics:** ADHD roots in stress, dopamine dynamics, the biopsychosocial model of addiction, and compassionate inquiry (Gabor Maté).

## 🎯 Our Core Identity

**The Problem:** High-IQ, ambitious men are trapped in a "self-medication loop"—reliant on stimulants, caffeine, and digital dopamine to function, leading to erratic energy and diminishing returns.

**The Solution:** **Soft Reset**. A data-fueled, story-driven program that combines:
1.  **Biological Stabilization:** Smart tapering and "soft landing" protocols to kill the crash.
2.  **Psychological Reframing:** Moving from "patient" to "protagonist" in a hero's journey.
3.  **Elite Brotherhood:** High-accountability peer support.
4.  **AI Coaching:** 24/7 guidance from Coach Bear to build the "Reflect-Act-Reward-Repeat" loop.

**The Goal:** **Stimulant Indifference.** A state where the user’s productivity, mood, and discipline are self-generated, and they possess full executive agency over their lives.
